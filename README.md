# Static Content Generation with Metalsmith

Home page of the tool -> (here)[https://metalsmith.io/]

Most of the code is almost entirely ripped from this (blog starter boilerplate)[https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-blog-starter/tree/main]

## Organization

Blog posts are generated based on markdown files in `./src/content/blog`

## Running locally

`npm run start` will host the site on localhost:3000

## Necessary caveats

Links to news.html need to go to /news instead
